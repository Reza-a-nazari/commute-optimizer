        Executes Simulated Annealing optimization.

        Guidelines:
        - Start from a high temperature where worse moves are accepted with significant probability.
        - Lower temperature over iterations according to a cooling schedule.
        - Downhill moves (improvements) must always be accepted.
        - Uphill moves (worse costs) should be accepted probabilistically according to temperature.
        - Record objective values throughout the run in self.history.

        Prohibited:
        - Ignoring the temperature parameter or turning this into pure hill climbing.
